Simple financial market dashboard

This is a simple dashboard showing stock, crypto, FX, and interest rate data from Jan 1 2020. It uses a tabbed layout when rendered to HTML. If rendered periodically using a cron job it will update data when existing data is more than one week old. This can be changed  by editing `updateinterval`.
